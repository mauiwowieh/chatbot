# Hey there!

Thanks for taking the time 🙏

Please don't create a Pull Request to the original repository. This is just a dummy project, which is used to demonstrate knowledge of Angular/Node.js and frontend/backend development in general. It serves as an exercise for candidates to show their skills and knowledge.

I'm eager to learn. Your feedback is highly appreciated.
